# Coucou! ðŸ‘‹

I'm Andrea Cabrera, an actress and philologist and now turned to an enthusiastic Data Analyst, all thanks to Adalab Data Analytics bootcamp. I have a passion for uncovering insights from data, such as identifying patterns and contributing to decision-making.

Here you can find all the projects that I've done with other people in order to implement all that I've been learning. Each project represents a significant milestone in my learning journey, from tackling business challenges to exploring intriguing datasets.

Join me in our shared adventure of data exploration! Let's have an enjoyable time together!âœ¨
